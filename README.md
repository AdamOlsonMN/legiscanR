legiscanR
=========

R functions to parse, clean, and organize data provided by the LegiScan API (http://legiscan.com/legiscan).  

Currently, the functions are only setup to process data provided by the master data downloads.  Work is currently underway to develop functions to wrap around the LegiScan API in R in JSON and XML formats.  The current functions only operate on the XML formatted files.
